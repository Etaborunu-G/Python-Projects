# Python Projects Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of Python projects developed to strengthen programming fundamentals, explore software design concepts, and apply Python to practical problems. It serves as both a learning archive and a professional portfolio of work.

--------------------------------------------------

Repository Structure

Each project is organized into its own directory and is designed to be self-contained.

Example structure:

python-projects/
|
|-- project-name-1/
|   |-- main.py
|   |-- README.md
|
|-- project-name-2/
|   |-- app.py
|   |-- requirements.txt
|
|-- README.md

--------------------------------------------------

Project Scope

The projects in this repository may include:
- Core Python programming exercises
- Object-oriented programming examples
- Data structures and algorithm implementations
- Automation and utility scripts
- Small-scale applications and simulations

Individual project directories may contain their own README files with specific details, instructions, and design notes.

--------------------------------------------------

Technologies and Tools

- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries
- Third-party libraries where applicable (documented per project)

--------------------------------------------------

Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-projects.git

2. Navigate to a specific project:
   cd python-projects/project-name

3. Run the application:
   python main.py

Some projects may require additional dependencies. Refer to the project's README or requirements.txt file if present.

--------------------------------------------------
