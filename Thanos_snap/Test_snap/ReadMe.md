## 🚨 Purpose of This Folder

This directory contains **non-critical documents and images** meant to safely demonstrate and test:

- Folder Snap functionality
- Snap strength percentages (10%–90%)
- File-type filtering
- Preview vs execution behavior
- Backup and restore workflows

This folder **exists to be snapped**.

## ❌ DO NOT

- Store personal photos or documents  
- Store coursework, assignments, or work files

- Assume files here are safe from deletion  

Even though Folder Snap sends files to the **Recycle Bin / Trash**, data loss is still possible.

## ✅ SAFE TO DO

- Experiment freely with snap modes  
- Run multiple snaps consecutively  
- Restore files from Trash if needed  
- Re-download or regenerate test files
